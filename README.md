Some Python assignments I completed in my Programming and Problem-Solving course in Fall 2023. Some topics covered include variables, 
types, mathematical and boolean expressions, user IO, number systems, and the math/random modules, selection (if) statements, and for- 
and while-loops, strings, custom functions, file IO, lists, and tuples.
